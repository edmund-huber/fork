libfork
=======

A simple implementation of basic routines and data structures for the Fork Language.

This is incredibly alpha, so it may crash in unpredictable ways.

Everything is available under the MPL v2 license.

# Building

Libfork needs transmod from libctrans to compile, and it's generally developed in sync with it.
Use a current build of libctrans to build libfork, or otherwise get it from an official build (see libctrans releases for more informations).
