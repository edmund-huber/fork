libforkparse
============

The implementation of the reference parser and AST for the Fork language.

This is incredibly alpha, so it may crash in unpredictable ways.

Everything is available under the MPL v2 license.

# Building
libforkparse is part of [fork](http://github.com/forklang/fork), a Fork compiler.

libforkparse needs transmod to compile, and they are generally developed in sync.
Use a current build of Fork to build libforkparse, or otherwise get it from an official build (see fork releases for more informations).
